# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
ARC Game is a web-based application where users solve ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenges by writing Python.

## Commands
- To run the application locally: Use a simple HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server`)
- No build process or compilation required
- No specific test commands - visual inspection in browser is the primary testing method

## Error Handling
- JavaScript: Use try/catch blocks with console.error for errors
- Provide user-friendly error messages where possible
- Log detailed error information to console
